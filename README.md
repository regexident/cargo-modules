## Synopsis

A cargo plugin for showing a tree-like overview of a crate's modules.

## Motivation

With time, as your Rust projects grow bigger and bigger,
it gets more and more important to properly structure your code.
Fortunately Rust provides us with a quite sophisticated module system,
allowing us to neatly split up our crates into arbitrarily small sub-modules
of types and functions. While this helps to avoid monolithic and unstructured
chunks of code, it can also make it hard at times to still mentally stay
on top of the over-all high-level structure of the project at hand.

This is where `cargo-modules` comes into play:

## Installation

Install `cargo-modules` on nightly via:

```bash
cargo install cargo-modules
```

Or using rustup's ad-hoc mode:

```bash
rustup run nightly cargo install cargo-modules
```

Or if you want to build it locally:

```bash
$ rustup run nightly cargo build --release
```

## Usage

```bash
cargo modules
```

### Orphaned Modules

If you want to also list of potentially orphaned modules,
then add a `--orphans` argument:

```bash
cargo modules --orphans
```

Any file `src/../foo.rs` or `src/../foo/mod.rs` that is not linked by its
`super`-module via `mod foo;` is considered a (potential) orphaned module.

To keep false positives to a minimum `cargo-modules` excludes all build scripts
as well as `lib.rs` and `main.rs` from the selection of potential orphans.

### Plain Mode

If you, for some reason, need to remove the coloring, use:

```bash
cargo modules --plain
```

### Help

If you need any further help:

```bash
cargo modules --help
```
